# Pitch Perfect
An iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

### Technology used
Swift 4

### Steps to use the app
* Download/clone the git repository
* Open xcode with the project folder
* Build and run the app on any iPhone simulator
* (Optional) Connect your iPhone to the PC and deploy the app to enjoy the app in your phone.

### Learning experience
* Creating a new project from existing iOS app templates
* Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
* Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
* Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
* Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
* Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
* Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
* Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code

### Why is this project meaningful to my career?
MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development; understanding these principles early sets you on the path to success. Learning how to find answers to development questions by searching documentation emulates the practice of expert software engineers.
